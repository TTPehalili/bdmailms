/**
 * Outbound Writing & Cold Calling Frameworks Registry
 * Built for enterprise SDR floors to generate short, hyper-personalized,
 * anti-sales, peer-to-peer cold calls, cold emails, and LinkedIn messages using Gemini.
 * 
 * CORE PHILOSOPHY:
 * 1. Two-way consultative dialogue: 80% about the prospect's reality, <20% about the SDR.
 * 2. Consultant mindset: Diagnose leaks like a doctor, never pitch like a telemarketer.
 * 3. Grounded in CSV intelligence: Persona-specific, never one-size-fits-all.
